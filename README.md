Deep reinforcement learning for traffic light control in transportation networks

<h2>Introduction </h1><br>
In this repository, a deep reinforcement learning model for traffic light control is provided. The main task of this model is to improve the performance of traffic lights with reinforcement learning methods and the use of deep learning networks. If the traffic light is ineffective, it causes problems such as travel delays, energy loss, air pollution, vehicle accidents, etc.
The existing traffic lights have a fixed schedule and do not take into account momentary traffic. Others use sensors on the ground to determine how many cars are waiting in front of the light. This model of lights has low efficiency. For example, during a football match or peak traffic hours, most of these systems are paralyzed. In these cases, the police control the traffic manually. Observing the police and this manual operator gives this motivation to design a system like that. This system requires an eye to observe the momentary intersection traffic and a brain to process it.
The eye can recognize the number of cars, as well as where and when they are waiting. Reinforcement learning is used for the brain part of the system. This section also has three parts: states, actions, and rewards that we must model for use in the deep network.
